## Why Teams Choose Kodus

- **Model Agnostic**: Use Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Llama, GLM, Kimi or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Zero Markup on LLM Costs**: You pay model providers directly. No hidden multipliers.
- **Learns from Your Context**: Kody adapts to your architecture, standards, and workflow.
- **You Set the Rules**: Define custom review rules in plain language.
- **Privacy & Security**: Source code is not used to train models, data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and self-hosted runners are supported. Self-hosted instances send one anonymous heartbeat per day (aggregated counters only — no code, names, or identifiers); opt out with `KODUS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true`. See [Anonymous Telemetry](https://docs.kodus.io/how_to_deploy/en/deploy_kodus/telemetry).
- **Native Git Workflow**: Works directly in PRs with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos.
- **CLI + CI/CD Ready**: Run reviews locally and in pipelines.
- **Operational Impact**: Track technical debt and delivery metrics while keeping review quality high.
