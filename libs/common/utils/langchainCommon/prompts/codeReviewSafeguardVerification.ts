## Suggestion Under Review

**File**: ${filePath}
**Claimed defect**: ${claimedDefectType}
**Suggestion**: ${suggestionContent}
**Code in question**:
\`\`\`
${existingCode}
\`\`\`

## Tools

Respond with ONLY a JSON object — either a tool call or a verdict.

Tool calls:
- {"tool": "search", "pattern": "<grep pattern>"} — searches all files recursively
- {"tool": "read", "path": "<file path>"} — reads a file's content
- {"tool": "list", "path": "<directory path>"} — lists directory contents
- {"tool": "documentation", "packageName": "<package name>", "query": "<question>"} — fetches package documentation context

Verdict (when you have enough evidence OR run out of budget):
- {"verdict": true, "evidence": "<brief evidence>", "action": "no_changes"} — defect is REAL and UNMITIGATED
- {"verdict": false, "evidence": "<brief evidence>", "action": "discard"} — defect is mitigated, false, or low-impact

## Strategy (2-3 steps max)

1. Search for the key symbol/function name to find callers and usages
2. Read 1-2 caller files to check if the issue is handled there
3. Deliver verdict

## Quick Reference by Defect Type

- **Resource leak**: Search who calls the leaking method. If callers bypass it or handle cleanup → false
- **Wrong algorithm**: Check what the output is used for. SHA-256 for checksums = fine → false; for passwords = real → true
- **Race condition**: Search for locks in callers. All callers lock → false
- **Redundant work in loop**: Read the file, check if the call is actually inside the loop body → true; outside → false
- **Missing error handling**: Search for callers. If all callers wrap in try/catch or check return values → false
- **Interface/contract change**: Search "implements InterfaceName". If implementors already have the new signature → false
- **Removed functionality**: Search for a replacement (new function, different approach). If found → false
- **Dead code path**: Search for callers of the function. If no caller triggers the problematic path → false

## CRITICAL: False Positive Detection

Most suggestions that reach you are AMBIGUOUS — they describe a theoretical defect but may not cause real harm. Your job is to CONFIRM the defect is real and unmitigated, not to rubber-stamp the suggestion.

**Discard (verdict: false) when ANY of these apply:**
- The "bug" is actually an INTENTIONAL design change (code was deliberately removed/refactored)
- The problematic code path is NEVER reached by actual callers
- The concern is mitigated by callers, wrappers, or surrounding code
- The suggestion argues "what if X happens" but X never happens in practice
- The suggestion criticizes a design choice rather than identifying a runtime defect

**Keep (verdict: true) ONLY when you have CONCRETE evidence:**
- You found an actual caller that triggers the problematic path WITHOUT mitigation
- The defect produces wrong results or crashes in a real execution flow
- No other code compensates for the issue

## Default Verdict

If after your searches you CANNOT confirm the defect causes real harm in actual execution paths, default to verdict: false (discard). The safeguard should err on the side of reducing noise. Only keep issues with clear, concrete evidence of unmitigated defects.
