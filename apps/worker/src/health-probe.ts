/**
 * Minimal HTTP server for ECS container health checks.
 *
 * Three failure modes that matter, in order of detection difficulty:
 *
 *   1. Connection dead: amqp.managedConnection.isConnected() === false.
 *      Easy to catch — the library knows.
 *
 *   2. Connection alive, but a channel we depend on has zero consumers.
 *      This is the "zombie" pattern we traced in prod: lib reconnected
 *      after a channel close but the @RabbitSubscribe consumer didn't
 *      re-register. Connection looks fine; messages pile up. Catching
 *      this requires inspecting AmqpConnection._consumers (a Record
 *      keyed by consumerTag, populated by golevelup's
 *      registerConsumerForQueue) and grouping by msgOptions.channel.
 *      This is internal state of @golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq but stable
 *      enough across recent versions to rely on. NOTE: layout changed
 *      in v9 — older lib versions tracked consumers on each
 *      ChannelWrapper; if the lib is downgraded, this probe needs to
 *      be adapted again.
 *
 *   3. Connection alive, consumers registered, but the worker is wedged
 *      (event loop pinned, all jobs stuck). That's out of scope for
 *      this probe — would need a liveness signal from the handler
 *      itself (e.g. "last ack timestamp > N ago"). Tracked separately.
 *
 * Failing this probe causes ECS to mark the task unhealthy and start a
 * new one, which is the right call for cases 1 and 2: both are
 * unrecoverable without reconnecting at the AMQP library level.
