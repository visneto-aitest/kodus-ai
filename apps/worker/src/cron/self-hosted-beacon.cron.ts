/**
 * Daily anonymous heartbeat for self-hosted instances. Sends one POST per
 * UTC day to the `kodus-beacon` receiver (telemetry.kodus.io); the service
 * itself owns dedupe, opt-out, and `instance_id` persistence.
 *
 * Schedule: 03:17 UTC daily — the odd minute is intentional jitter so the
 * global fleet doesn't stampede the receiver at the top of the hour.
 *
 * Scope: self-hosted only. Cloud already has rich product telemetry via
 * PostHog/Resend/n8n; the cloud control plane has no use for its own
 * heartbeat. Skip on cloud entirely.
 *
 * Boot transparency: on first init in self-hosted mode, log a single line
 * announcing the telemetry state and how to inspect / disable it. This is
 * the highest-leverage trust signal — operators see it the first time they
 * boot the worker, without having to read docs.
