description: Use when the user asks to review code or prepare commit/push/PR/merge with quality checks using the local Kodus CLI build against a dev API. Trigger on terms like review, commit, push, pull request, merge, or quality gate. Not for PR-vs-task business rules validation.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires a local Kodus CLI build in this repository, a reachable dev Kodus API, and Bash support for the helper script. Prefer non-interactive authentication via team key or explicit credentials.

# Kodus Review (Dev)

## Goal

Use the local Kodus CLI build in this repository to review changes and resolve issues. Prefer machine-friendly output via `--prompt-only`, then apply fixes in code.

If the request is to validate a pull request against business rules, task requirements, or acceptance criteria, use `business-rules-validation` instead. The local review command does not trigger `@kody -v business-logic`.

## Trigger Hints

- Treat mentions of `review`, `commit`, `push`, `open PR`, `merge`, `quality gate`, or `ready to ship` as triggers for this skill.
- For commit/push/merge requests, proactively ask to run local Kodus review first when a fresh review has not run yet in the current task.

## Workflow

0. Apply review gate on delivery actions.

- If the user asks to commit/push/merge/open PR and did not explicitly skip review, ask whether to run `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh review --prompt-only` first.
- If the user declines, continue with the requested delivery action and clearly note review was skipped by user choice.

1. Ensure local dev command is available.

- Use the helper script: `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh --help`.
- The script resolves `dist/index.js` from this repository and defaults `KODUS_API_URL` to `http://localhost:3001`.
- If `dist/index.js` is missing, run `npm run build` before continuing.

2. Ensure authentication if required.

- Run `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh auth status` first.
- Prefer `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh auth team-key --key <key>` when the user provides a team key.
- If the user provides email and password explicitly, use `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh auth login --email <email> --password <password>`.
- If auth is missing and only interactive login is possible, stop and ask the user to authenticate manually rather than relying on prompts.

3. Run review using prompt-only output.

- Default: `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh review --prompt-only`.
- If user specifies files: append `<files...>`.
- If user asks for staged/commit/branch: add `--staged`, `--commit <sha>`, or `--branch <name>`.
- If user wants fast: add `--fast`.

4. Parse results and apply fixes.

- Use the output to locate files and lines.
- Make minimal, targeted changes to address each issue.
- If an issue is not actionable or is a false positive, explain why and skip.

5. Re-run review if needed.

- After fixes, rerun `skills/kodus-review-dev/scripts/run-local-cli.sh review --prompt-only` to confirm issues are resolved.

## Notes

- Prefer `--prompt-only` for predictable parsing.
- Avoid `--interactive` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Redirect PR-vs-task validation requests to `business-rules-validation`.
- The helper script respects `KODUS_API_URL`, `KODUS_VERBOSE`, and `KODUS_CLI_ENTRYPOINT`.
- Do not use `--fix` unless the user explicitly asks.
